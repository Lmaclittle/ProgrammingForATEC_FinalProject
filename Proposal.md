# The Spotify Game

## Repository
<https://github.com/Lmaclittle/ProgrammingForATEC_FinalProject>

## Description
This is a game that brings up a image that the player will then have to guess what piece of music would best fit the image, (still figuring out if it should be a game that you play with a friend that decides or if it should be from a select amount if its the right fit). This would be a good fit as I can use pygame for it to make the game and can use my newly acquired skills in image manipulation to my advantage.

## Features
- Feature 1: Music
  - The code will get music from Spotifys repo which the player can then play to decide what fits best.
- Feature 2: Voting System
  - The player can vote/guess for what piece of music fits with the image the best.
- Feature 3: Random Photographs
  - It will show a random photo for the player to make their decisions based off of that pic.

## Challenges
- I need to figure out a way to get spotifys repo to use for the music.
- Figure out how to randomly select photos.
- Voting system implementation.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The game describes what it does, it then brings up a random image and asks the player what piece of music is best. The player then finds/selects a piece of music they think fits the overall feel of the image. If I go the answer mode, it will say the song was right/wrong. If I go to the voting mode it will ask the player who is judging if the piece of music fits the image, if it does the player is rewarded a point, and so on.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- It shows an image, asks what song fits best out of these 4, and gives a point if correct.
