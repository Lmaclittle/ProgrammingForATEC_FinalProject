## Description
This is a "judgement based" game (think stuff like Cards Against Humanity, Apple To Apples) where a picture is displayed, and then players have to use the music search box to find the song think fits the "vibe" of the image. For example if its a chirstmas picture then obviously stuff like "Have Yourself A Merry Little Chirstmas", "Most Wonderful Time of The Year", etc. From there the judge of the game will be able to see the picture and decide which song each player picked fits the image better. From then on there will be a winner.

## REQUIREMENTS & NOTES
1. You need at least 3 people to play this game, 1 to judge and 2 to submit. There is no limit to the amount of people you need.
2. When it asks for the amount of people just put however many you have -1 as it does not count the judge as a player.
3. If you need pip requirements check this link: https://vscode.dev/github/Lmaclittle/ProgrammingForATEC_FinalProject/blob/main/requriements.txt
4. Have fun!

## Additional Notes - Regrets, Pride, & Improvements
I tried to implement a thing that plays songs, but I could not figure out, If I was able to implement it definitely could have helped the game a lot. I also wished I could have a button that resets the game easier, but unfortunately time was not on my side. I am pretty happy with how the whole music search box thing came out though, I think that came out really well and is super easy to use. If I had the chance in the future it would be cool If I could get this to work online or something as I think it could work really well as a party game for a phone or for Discord or something like that.
